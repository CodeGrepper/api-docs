# Introduction

Welcome to the Grepper API Devs! If you just looking to use the API. Visit the [Official Grepper API docs](https://staging.codegrepper.com/api-docs/).

If you are looking to contribute... AWESOME. We are using slate to help document our api, you can view/edit [index.html.md](https://github.com/CodeGrepper/api-docs/blob/main/index.html.md) in this repo which builds out our official docs, which you can [find here](https://staging.codegrepper.com/api-docs/).

We are working on building out client libraries (API Bindings) in different languages if you want to contribute or use them you can see them here:
